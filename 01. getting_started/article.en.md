Welcome to the PIVX Documentation website, check out our quickstart guides, tutorials, and FAQs!

The community is very active on Discord, so [Join us on the PIVX Discord!](https://discord.pivx.org/)

If you want to learn more about PIVX itself, head out to our official website: https://pivx.org/, and read the PIVX Economics Whitepaper available on the [PIVX Economics](https://pivx.org/economics?target=_blank) page.

### Getting Started with PIVX

The first thing you will need is a wallet to hold your PIVs. The PIVX Core Wallet is the solution that offers the most advantages:
* It has all the functionalities of the PIVX network available natively
* It is the most secure option
* Running the Core Wallet adds a full node to the blockchain, so you contribute to running the PIVX network

Head out to the [PIVX Core Wallet](/pivx-core-wallet) section of the documentation and decide if it's the right solution for you!

You can also choose a thirdparty wallet in [Mobile & Hardware Wallets](/mobile-hardware-wallets)

### Buying PIVX

Once your wallet is up and running, you need to pick an exchange and buy your first PIVs using either Fiat money or another Cryptocurrency. The PIVX project maintains a list of exchanges in the relevant section of the PIVX website: [Exchanges](https://pivx.org/exchanges).

You can then transfer your PIVs from the exchange to your core wallet.
