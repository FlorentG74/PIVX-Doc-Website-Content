    questions:
      - question: "Why is staking inactive on my core wallet?"
        response: "Please start with making sure you meet all requirements listed on that page [Staking](/staking). If this doesn't help, run the **getstakingstatus** command in the core wallet command line or debug console; any 'false' value should be investigated as they are likely the cause for staking to be de-activated."
      - question: "I have been staking X PIVs for Y days and haven't received a reward yet. Is anything broken?"
        response: "Verify the staking status of your core wallet. If active, your next best option is to give it time, as the frequency on which a staker will receive rewards is completely random. The staking calculator on [https://pivx.org/proof-of-stake](https://pivx.org/proof-of-stake) will provide you with an expected return/staking frequency that can help manage your expectations."
